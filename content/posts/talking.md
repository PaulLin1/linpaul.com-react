A quote that was quite formative to me in high school went something like: “Not every architect, actually, most architects, should not aspire to be like Frank Gehry.” Gehry's one of the premier American architects, whose buildings are works of art camouflaged as living spaces. Ironically, he studied urban planning in university, a field that arguably contributes far more directly to society than his sometimes Seussian buildings. Upon hearing that quote, I realized I didn’t want to be an architect. My imagination of the job had been full of flashy, Renzo Piano style buildings, like the background of my personal website, but architecture needs to be so much more than that. Society also needs the people who do the mundane tasks: building suburbs, gas stations, and infrastructure. Perhaps, if you get lucky, you might have a chance to design a townhouse. That all sounds pretty obvious, but is this what young students imagine architecture school to be? Deep down they all aspire to be Gehry.
My vision of a “starving artist” is someone who refuses to compromise, only pursuing their own idea, even when they aren’t viable. But sometimes, you have roll up your sleeves, download Photoshop, and do work of value.
Is there such thing as a profit-driven musician. Compared to rockstars, jingle writers and soundtrack composers are bit more pedestrian, but arguably just as indulgent in their work. But Todd Edwards says there needs to be more Daft Punks.
